# macr0

4-button HID compliant USB macro keypad.

This is a test project to try out a few things before attempting a larger-scale project.  Some proofs of concepts - things I haven't done before.

A bunch of extra info can be found at [clews.pro][link_clews_macr0].

Goals for this project:
- [X] HID compliant USB peripheral using an ATmega32U4 microcontroller.
- [X] Keys will be mechanical Gateron switches - these are pin-compatible Cherry MX clones.
- [X] Keys will all be LED back-lit.
- [X] Back-light illumination will be adjustable.
- [X] Connectivity (and power) will be via a USC-C connector, configured for USB 2.0.
